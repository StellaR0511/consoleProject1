        <h3>Visual Studio Code is a app that lets you code with JavaScript and other coding languages. To use it, you have to first download the app, then you create a folder on the desktop screen and name it. Next you go into the Visual Studio Code app, and on the side of your screen, click explorer(the one with the document icon). Then you click File, then Open Folder..., then choose the folder you made on desktop. If you are coding in JavaScript, go to the rectangle that says EXPLORER and under your folder name, right click and select New File. Name it index.html, then do the same for main.js and style.css. If you are not coding in JavaScript do the same as past instructions, but name the file your coding language. Now you can start coding!  </h3>

        <h3>To use console.log(), first go to main.js and type console.log(""), put what you want in the double quotes. If you want a variable in the console, don't use the double quotes. The console is important, so the developer can inform the user of the website on what the developer is doing. So that is why if you a developer, you should use console.log. To view the console on any website, you go the website, right click, then click on inspect or you can just click the buttons Ctrl + Shift + i at the same time. You then click Console on the top, and there you can view the console. The console is also the place where issues are stored, so that might be the only thing you see on the console, if you want only the message and not the issues, on the left of the inspect area, there should be something that says _ user messages. _ = the number of user messages the developer gave the user. Click that. Then you will only see user messages(messages for the user). Tip: Most apps don't have the inspect button, except for search engines, so you might not learn those apps' consoles.  </h3>
